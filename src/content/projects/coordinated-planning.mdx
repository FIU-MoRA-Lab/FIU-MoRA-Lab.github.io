description: "Multiple robots operating concurrently often can achieve their ends more efficiently by cooperating to mediate their use of shared resources. But, as the information that the robots possess is sensitive or restricted, this poses the question of how to preserve individual privacy whilst coordinating. To show the practical feasibility of Secure Multi-Party Computation in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, we examine several particular scenarios where we envision it being relevant to the context of coordination among robots, and propose three secure path intersection protocols:"
points:
  - "A secure path intersection protocol based on the polygon intersection ideas presented in and simplified to make its implementation feasible using open source software packages."
  - "A protocol that ensures that two robots will not collide while executing their task, its software implementation, and hardware proof of concept experiments."
  - "A new, secure 3D path collision protocol that can be used in plans involving time or 3D workspaces."
