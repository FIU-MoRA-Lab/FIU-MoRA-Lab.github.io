description: "This Project is to efficiently explore and gather information from unknown spatial fields using decentralized mobile robots presents a significant challenge. Existing approaches that are limited to discrete domains and synchronous planning often struggle to scale well as the problem size increases. To address this, our motivation is to develop an incremental scalable motion planning algorithm that operates in continuous domains and employs an asynchronous communication strategy. The goal is to guide a team of cooperative robots to visit the most informative locations within a limited mission duration, where the informativeness is specified by a density function. In this project, we make four contributions:"
points: 
  - "Propose an Asynchronous Information Gathering with Bayesian Optimization (AsyncIGBO) algorithm to choose the next informative samples for robots subject to their observed knowledge"
  - "Estimate the unknown density function from gathered samples with independently exploring multiple robots"
  - "Generate a distributed control law in continuous domains while considering realistic robotic resource and motion constraints"
  - "Theoretically analyze the asymptotic no-regret properties of our algorithm with respect to a known spatial field"
