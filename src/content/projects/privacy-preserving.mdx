description: "The concept of multi-robot task allocation holds immense potential for identifying synergies between robots and optimizing their collective performance. While it is straightforward to achieve cooperation within a single organization, challenges arise when robots are competitors in a marketplace, safeguarding proprietary data and copyrights. However, limited cooperation among rivals, especially in the form of resource sharing and infrastructure utilization, can significantly reduce costs for all parties involved. Recognizing that competition and cooperation are not mutually exclusive, we address the crucial question of how to optimally allocate robots to tasks while upholding data privacy and confidentiality. Our approach tackles this question by:"
points:
  - "Implementing an auction-based assignment algorithm through secure multi-party computation operations, eliminating the need for a trusted auctioneer."
  - "By ensuring that no task valuations, utilities, positions, or related data are released, we provide precise and robust privacy guarantees that surpass existing methods."
  - "This innovative approach empowers multi-robot systems to collaborate effectively without compromising sensitive information, fostering a secure environment for cooperation in competitive landscapes."
