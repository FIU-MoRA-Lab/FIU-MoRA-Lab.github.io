description: "There is a need for semi-autonomous systems capable of performing both automated tasks and supervised maneuvers. When dealing with multiple robots or robots with high complexity (such as humanoids), we face the issue of effectively coordinating multiple operators across robots. We build on our previous work to present a methodology for designing trajectories and policies for robots such that few operators can supervise multiple robots. Specifically, we:"
points:
  - "Analyze of the complexity of the problem"
  - "Provide a methodology for designing policies so that operators can oversee many robots"
  - "Present a method for designing policies and robot trajectories to permit operators to oversee multiple robots"
  - "Include simulation and hardware experiments demonstrating our methodologies."
